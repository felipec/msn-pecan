== Miscellaneous ==

 * remove sync.c, it only complicates things. Also, there's issues with the
   initial login (new account).

== GObjectification ==

The objective is that all of the important structures in msn-pecan are
developed using GObject.

 * Network I/O
   * Command server (done)
   * HTTP server (done)
   * Notification server
   * Switchboard server
   * Direct Connection (p2p)
   * Nexus (authentication)

 * AddressBook
   * Contact
   * Group
   * Contact List

 * CVR

== Unit Testing ==

For this better modularization is required so individual modules can tested
independently. Also, to be able to work without libpurple.

 * Modularization
  * Network I/O
  * AddressBook
  * CVR

 * Unit Tests
  * Utilities
    * Command parsing
    * Message parsing
    * Transaction handling
  * Network I/O
  * AddressBook
  * CVR

== Utilities ==

=== printf ===

GLib's printf utility is sub-obtimal so a custom one has been developed in
msn-pecan. It's far from being complete, and probably should be pushed into
mainline GLib.

So that g_print ("%s", NULL) works on all architectures. Currently that crashes
in Windows.

== Documentation ==

 * Overview, architecture
 * Create design diagrams
 * Use doxygen
 * Add documentation to: http://imfreedom.org/wiki/index.php/MSN
 * Examples of communications (client/server, p2p)

== Other ideas ==

 * Create a standalone library.
 * Don't rely on GLib's mainloop. (for Adium X)
 * Use gio
 * Use libsoup
 * Properly use and test pecan_buffer.
 * Port offline message support from libgmsn.
 * Allow cancel in authorization dialog.
 * Allow alias from the add buddy dialog.
